## Features

1. **EXIF Details:** Provides a tabular view of the metadata contained within an image. This feature allows users to examine various technical details such as camera settings, exposure times, and more.
2. **RGB Channel Analysis:** Allows users to view individual channels of red, green, and blue within an image. This feature is useful for understanding color compositions and corrections.
3. **HSV Distribution:** Analyzes the hue, saturation, and value distribution within an image, providing insights into the overall color balance and quality.
4. **Color Distribution Visualization:** Visualizes the distribution of primary colors within an image, helping users understand the color dynamics and dominance within their photos.
5. **3D Color Space Visualization:** Observes the colors in the image in a 3D space, offering a unique perspective on the color relationships and compositions.
6. **Pixel Density Polar Analysis:** Evaluates the concentration of pixels across different angles, which can be particularly useful for understanding focus and composition.
7. **3D Surface (Color Intensities):** Explores the color intensity surface and peaks within an image, providing a detailed view of color variations and intensities.
8. **Color Palette Generation:** Generates a color palette based on the colors present in the image, which can be useful for design and artistic purposes.

[Exifa's](https://exifaa.streamlit.app/) capabilities extend beyond images. It also has powerful document handling features, allowing you to ask follow-up questions about documents and even strip all metadata from images. In addition, Exifaâ€™s ability to retain context extends to explaining technical EXIF terms. When you ask about specific terms or request comparisons between technical details, the model leverages its memory to provide coherent and accurate explanations.
